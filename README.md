Browser Game Collection
Project Mission
This project features a growing collection of browser-based games created using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose is to demonstrate how simple yet engaging interactive experiences can be built with fundamental web technologies, without external libraries or frameworks.
Current Games

A recreation of the popular Flappy Bird game where players navigate a bird through gaps between pipes using simple but challenging flight mechanics.
Papi Jump
A vertical platformer where players control a bouncing character that jumps upward on procedurally generated platforms, with score based on height achieved.

Future Plans
This collection will expand with additional browser games, each focused on demonstrating different game mechanics and design principles.
